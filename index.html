                <h3>SpeakEasy</h3>
                <p>SpeakEasy is a hands free AI powered language learning app. It allows users to learn their langauge of choice completely hands free in situations such
                    as driving a car. The frontend is built in Javascript and the backend is built in Python, all connected via Flask. I was primarily responsible for building the 
                    flask server, managing the control flow, and dealing with audio input and output.

                <h3>Baseball Card Maker (In progress)</h3>
                <p>Baseball Card maker is a React App that allows users to create fully custom Baseball cards using real MLB data. The backend is mostly complete, leveraging pybaseball in python 
                    to generate real player stat lines, that then can be displayed on the frontend. The frontend is in development, using the Mosiac package in React to allow the user to drag around
                    different components of a baseball card to create a fully custom card.
